    rel="dns-prefetch" makes sure that third-party contents from a
    specific URL are loaded faster. How? We do the DNS handshake now
    and not when said file is requested, so we have that part of the
    whole connection process out of the way already.

    When this is helpful? Are you using a CDN for assets? Do you use
    webfonts being served from a third-party domain? Here you go!
    Oh, Analytics are another option.

    This attribute has great support: http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-dns-prefetch
  -->
  <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="http://whatever-domain.abc" />

  <!--
    On top of the above you could do the complete DNS, TCP, TLS
    handshake in the background with the following rel-attribute.

    Support's not that great though: http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect
  -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="http://whatever-domain.abc" />

  <!--
    If there is a single file you wish to prefetch for your visitors,
    you can do so as well. You could go the route of telling the
    browser that a certain resource is needed on subsequent visits,
    so it will be loaded at some point and be placed in the visitor's
    cache.
    Could be a file on your server or whereever.
  -->
  <link rel="prefetch" href="file.xyz" />

  <!--
    If there is a single file you wish to be loaded parallely to the
    initial request to your HTML or whatever comes first, you should
    go with rel="subresource". That makes sure this file will be
    loaded as fast as possible as you mark it as high priority that
    way.

    Again, this file could be on your server as well as it can be
    some third-party stylesheet, script, webfont or whatever.
  -->
  <link rel="subresource" href="file.xyz" />

  <!--
    All of the above being said: Don't overdo this. The more you
    add the more you're back to the standard way browsers request
    your files over the network.

  <!--
    Now for something special: rel="prerender"...
    1. You shouldn't do this to your users, as this will download
      a whole page and all files related to it into the users
      cache.
    2. You can do this for pages you know your visitors will visit
      next on your own website. For example in a shop, where you
      know that people who look at their cart might check out of
      the shop next. So on the cart.html page you set a <link>
      element in the head with rel="prerender" and a href of
      checkout.html for example. The checkout will render
      instantly - no loading time.

    The worst thing would be to laod a whole different domain
    with this technique. You would add huge amounts of data to
    your visitors cache without knowing, if he's ever going to
    use it because sometimes people don't do what you want them
    to do on your website. Amazing! Right? ;-)
