  <!-- Resource Hints: https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/#resource-hints

    rel="dns-prefetch" makes sure that third-party contents from a
    specific URL are loaded faster. How? We do the DNS handshake now
    and not when said file is requested, so we have that part of the
    whole connection process out of the way already.

    When this is helpful? Are you using a CDN for assets? Do you use
    webfonts being served from a third-party domain? Here you go!
    Oh, Analytics are another option.

    This attribute has great support: http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-dns-prefetch
  -->
  <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="http://whatever-domain.abc" />

  <!--
    On top of the above you could do the complete DNS, TCP, TLS
    handshake in the background with the following rel-attribute.

    Make sure to add the crossorigin boolean!

    Support's getting better: http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect
  -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="http://whatever-domain.abc" crossorigin />

  <!--
    If there is a single file you wish to prefetch for your visitors,
    you can do so as well. You could go the route of telling the
    browser that a certain resource is needed on subsequent visits,
    so it will be loaded at some point and be placed in the visitor's
    cache.
    Could be a file on your server or whereever.
  -->
  <link rel="prefetch" href="file.xyz" />

  <!--
    All of the above being said: Don't overdo this. The more you
    add the more you're back to the standard way browsers request
    your files over the network.
    Making all files high priority won't make the UX any better may be
    you'll make it even worse as browsers are already quite savvy
    with prioritizing.

  <!--
    Now for something special: rel="prerender"...
    1. You shouldn't do this to your users, as this will download
      a whole page and all files related to it into the users
      cache (more realistically it's an invisible tab in the back).
    2. You can do this for pages you know your visitors will visit
      next on your own website. For example in a shop, where you
      know that people who look at their cart might check out of
      the shop next. So on the cart.html page you set a <link>
      element in the head with rel="prerender" and a href of
      checkout.html for example. The checkout will render
      instantly - no loading time.

    The worst thing would be to laod a whole different domain
    with this technique. You would add huge amounts of data to
    your visitors cache without knowing, if he's ever going to
    use it because sometimes people don't do what you want them
    to do on your website. Amazing! Right? ;-)

  <link rel="prerender" href="probably-next-page.extension" />

  <!--
    The most recent link-rel-thingy we got and it is already supported in
    Chrome: preload. preload is like ServerPush because you can send files over
    to the user while the HTML is downloading.

    Nice technique*: in order to prevent a stylesheet from blocking the
    rendering path but have it at your user's machine asap, we can do the
    following.

    *: See the <noscript> section at the end of the <head> section of this page for
    the fallback to this technique.
